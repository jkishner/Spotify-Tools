If you get a Spotify share URL like `http://open.spotify.com/album/3eAA4fvTVttgUlE43vRVMq` and open it in Safari for iOS, use this bookmarklet to jump directly to 
that artist/album/track in the Spotify app.

This bookmarklet will _not_ work if the URL starts with `https`. It will open the app, but not to the artist/album/track corresponding with the web page.
